## Data Description

The dataset utilized in this study comprises comprehensive information encompassing imaging studies and clinical data obtained from 75 patients diagnosed with brain metastases (BMs). The data were collected from five distinct medical institutions, with strict inclusion criteria to ensure data quality and relevance.

### Patient Selection
- Adult patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of BM.
- Data spanned from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2021.

### Imaging Data
- Post-contrast T1-weighted high-resolution MRI sequences.
- Pixel spacing ≤ 2 mm, slice thickness ≤ 2 mm, no gaps between slices.
- Only images devoid of noise or artifacts included.

### Clinical Data
- Age at diagnosis, gender, treatment regimens, survival statistics.

### Primary Tumor Distribution
- Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): 38 cases
- Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): 5 cases
- Breast cancer: 22 cases
- Melanoma: 6 cases
- Ovarian cancer: 2 cases
- Kidney cancer: 1 case
- Uterine cancer: 1 case

### Brain Metastases Data
- 75 patients with 260 distinct BMs.
- 637 imaging studies, 593 of which underwent semi-automatic segmentation.
